Source and slides for BayHac 2017 presentation.

To make from source, Agda and XeLaTeX must be installed.
* In the agda directory, run `agda --latex BayHac.lagda`
* Then in the slides directory, run `xelatex bayhac.tex`
The latter command may need to be run more than once, for example if the number of pages changes.
